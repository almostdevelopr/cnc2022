			/*The variable add is assigned to the return value of a self-invoking function.
            The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.
            This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.
            This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
            The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.*/
